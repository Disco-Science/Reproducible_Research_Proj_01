Here I am loading libraries and setting global settings for the Rmd! 
 
```{r, label = 'Loading libraries', echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(lattice)
library(rmarkdown)


```

Loading file 'activity.csv' as a data.frame(); 
column 'dates' are converted from character into a date object by lubridate;
NA's are removed;
dates categorized as logical for Weekend

```{r, label = 'Data loading', echo = TRUE}
data = read.table("~/Desktop/activity.csv", 
                  sep = ",",
                  header = TRUE
                  ) %>% 
        mutate(date = ymd(date)) %>% 
        na.omit() %>% 
        mutate(day.of.the.week = weekdays(date),
               Weekend = ifelse(day.of.the.week == "Saturday" | day.of.the.week == "Sunday", "Weekend", "Weekday")
        )
```


Q:
What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

Assignment: 
Calculate the total number of steps taken per day; 
Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day

Solution:
I pass the data.frame() processed and group the data by the date;
I then call to summarize() and pass for functions sum, mean, and median;
Then add a column to categorize as the "Original" data 

```{r, label = 'tidy', echo = TRUE}

avgDataByDate = data %>%
        group_by(date) %>% 
        summarize(Total = sum(steps),
                  Average = mean(steps),
                  Median = median(steps)
        ) %>% 
        mutate(Group = "Original")

text01 = paste("The total number of steps taken per day is stored in the table")
text02 = paste("The average and median steps taken per day is stored in the table")
print(text01)
print(text02)

```

Assignment:
If you do not understand the difference between a histogram and a barplot, research the difference between them. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day

Solution:
I call the summarized table of the original data and call hist() function;
I pass the Total column of the df

```{r echo=TRUE}

hist(avgDataByDate$Total, 
     main = "Subjects' distribution of total steps in a day",
     breaks = 20,
     col = "red",
     xlab = "Total steps",
     ylab = "Frequency", 
     )

```

Question:
What is the average daily activity pattern?

Assignment:
Make a time series plot of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)

Solution:
I pass the original data and perform a grouping function by interval;
call summarize with functions calls to sum, length, min, quantile, mean, and max;
this produces a 5 point summary, but that is really only for me;
with the mean values and interval values, I pass those into ggplot():aes(); 
I then layer points and lines onto the base

```{r echo=TRUE}
test = data %>%
        group_by(interval) %>% 
        summarize(total = sum(steps),
                  "Total Reads" = length(steps),
                  Minimum = min(steps),
                  Q1 = quantile(steps, 0.25),
                  Average = mean(steps),
                  Median = median(steps),
                  Q3 = quantile(steps, 0.75),
                  Maximum = max(steps))

x = ggplot(NULL, aes(y = test$Average, x = test$interval))
x + geom_line() + geom_point() +
        labs(x = "Interval",
             y = "Average steps",
             title = "Average steps taken per interval across all data") +
        theme_classic()

```
Question
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?

Solution:
Use filter() to pull the row of the previous data.frame() that contains the max value among the Maximum column;
I then identify which interval that value is by pulling from that colum


```{r echo=TRUE}

intervalWithMaxSteps = test %>% filter(Average == max(test$Average))
intervalWithMaxSteps = intervalWithMaxSteps$interval

text = paste("The 5 minute interval with the highest average number of steps on average is", intervalWithMaxSteps)
print(text)

```

Question:
Imputing missing values
Note that there are a number of days/intervals where there are missing values (coded as \color{red}{\verb|NA|}NA). The presence of missing days may introduce bias into some calculations or summaries of the data.

Assignment: 
Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset (i.e. the total number of rows with \color{red}{\verb|NA|}NAs)

Solution:
Read raw data and pass into a filter call that identifies only rows with NA;
call dimensions on this dataframe and take only the rows (or the first value within the vector);
print that value

```{r echo=TRUE}

rowsNA = read.table("~/Desktop/activity.csv", 
                  sep = ",",
                  header = TRUE
                  ) %>% 
        filter_all(any_vars(is.na(.)))

numOfRowsNA = dim(rowsNA)[1]
numOfRowsNA = paste("The total number of missing values in the dataset is", numOfRowsNA)
print(numOfRowsNA)

```

Assignment:
Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy does not need to be sophisticated. For example, you could use the mean/median for that day, or the mean for that 5-minute interval, etc.

Solution:
Perform a for loop to ID NA values and replace with the overall average of steps over all rows

```{r echo=TRUE}
#fill in average value for that day 
newData = read.table("~/Desktop/activity.csv", 
                  sep = ",",
                  header = TRUE
                  ) %>% 
        mutate(date = ymd(date))

for (i in 1:length(newData$steps)) {
        
        if(is.na(newData$steps[i])) {
                
                newData$steps[i] = mean(avgDataByDate$Average)
                
        }
        
}

```

Assignment: 
Create a new dataset that is equal to the original dataset but with the missing data filled in.

Solution:
See previous statement and expression

```{r echo=TRUE}



```

Assignment:
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day and Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
Do these values differ from the estimates from the first part of the assignment? 
What is the impact of imputing missing data on the estimates of the total daily number of steps?

Solution:

Created a new dataframe that is grouped by date and provides sum, mean, and median of steps;
categorize data as altered;
create historgram with total steps per day; 
bind this 'altered' data with 'Original' data; 
call a plot function to compare both using facet_wrap();


```{r echo=TRUE}

avgNewDataByDate = newData %>%
        na.omit() %>% 
        group_by(date) %>% 
        summarize(Total = sum(steps),
                  Average = mean(steps),
                  Median = median(steps)
        ) %>% 
        mutate(Group = "Altered")

hist(avgNewDataByDate$Total, 
     main = "Subjects' distribution of total steps in a day",
     breaks = 20,
     col = "red",
     xlab = "Total steps",
     ylab = "Frequency", 
     )


compare = bind_rows(avgNewDataByDate, avgDataByDate)

x = ggplot(compare, aes(y = Average, x = date))

x + geom_line() + 
        geom_point() + 
        facet_wrap(Group ~ ., nrow = 2, dir ="v") +
        theme_classic() +
        labs(x = "Date",
             y = "Average steps") 

y = ggplot(compare, aes(y = Median, x = date))

y + geom_line() + 
        geom_point() + 
        facet_wrap(Group ~ ., nrow = 2, dir ="v") +
        theme_classic() +
        labs(x = "Date",
             y = "Average steps") 

text = paste("The impact of replacing values with the overall mean of steps does not impact the distribution or average significantly by eye; however, the median values on average could be changed significantly")

print(text)

```

Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
For this part the \color{red}{\verb|weekdays()|}weekdays() function may be of some help here. Use the dataset with the filled-in missing values for this part.

Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.

Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. \color{red}{\verb|type = "l"|}type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis). See the README file in the GitHub repository to see an example of what this plot should look like using simulated data.


```{r echo=TRUE}
test = data %>%
        na.omit() %>% 
        group_by(interval, Weekend) %>% 
        summarize(total = sum(steps),
                  "Total Reads" = length(steps),
                  Minimum = min(steps),
                  Q1 = quantile(steps, 0.25),
                  Average = mean(steps),
                  Median = median(steps),
                  Q3 = quantile(steps, 0.75),
                  Maximum = max(steps))

x = ggplot(test, aes(y = Average, x = interval))

x + geom_line() + 
        geom_point() + 
        facet_wrap(Weekend ~ ., nrow = 2, dir ="v") +
        theme_classic() +
        labs(x = "Interval",
             y = "Average steps",
             title = "Average steps taken per interval by day of the week") 

text = paste("Based on the graph on weekdays activity starts at earlier intervals and has a pronounced peak, where on weekends activity starts at later intervals and has probabaly a larger average value of peaks")

print(text)

```
